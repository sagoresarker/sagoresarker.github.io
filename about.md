Hello! I am a highly motivated and enthusiastic student pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Engineering. As a fourth-year (7th semester) student, I am well-versed in the concepts of computer programming, algorithms, and data structures.

My passion lies in Backend Engineering, specifically in Python and Golang. I am constantly working towards improving my skills and expanding my knowledge in this field. I have experience in API development for distributed systems using various technologies, such as FAST API, Flask, Docker, Redis, Microservices, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL. These tools and technologies have allowed me to build robust and scalable systems that can handle a large volume of traffic. I am continuously striving to expand my knowledge and skills in the field.

In addition to my technical skills, I am also a tech blogger. I write about topics related to software development, distributed systems, and new technology trends on my blog, Backend Byte. I enjoy sharing my insights and experiences with others and engaging in discussions about the latest trends in the industry.

As an aspiring entrepreneur, I am also working on my first startup, Backend Board, in the EdTech industry. The goal of this startup is to provide innovative solutions for learning and development in the backend technology space.

Outside of my studies and work, I am an avid problem-solver on the Leetcode platform. I enjoy taking on new challenges and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.

Whether you're a potential employer, a fellow engineer, or simply interested in learning more about my work, I'm excited to connect with you. Please feel free to browse my profile, check out my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or would like to connect further.

If you are interested in connecting with a motivated and dedicated Backend Engineer, I would be delighted to hear from you.
